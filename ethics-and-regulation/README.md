  - **Summary:**  
    This executive summary by Deloitte provides a high-level overview of the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act), which is set to become one of the world’s first comprehensive regulatory frameworks for AI systems. As of February 2025, the Act categorizes AI systems based on their risk level—unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal risk—and assigns corresponding obligations to developers and deployers of such systems.
    The document outlines the Act’s primary objective: to ensure the safe, transparent, and ethical deployment of AI while fostering innovation. It explains the specific obligations for high-risk AI systems, including conformity assessments, data governance protocols, transparency requirements, and post-market monitoring. These stipulations are particularly relevant for actuaries working with models that impact financial decisions, insurance underwriting, or algorithmic decision-making in sensitive domains.
    Deloitte also summarizes key compliance deadlines and provides insights into how businesses should begin preparing for the regulation, including steps for conducting risk assessments and establishing internal governance frameworks. The summary discusses penalties for non-compliance and the evolving role of national supervisory authorities.
    For actuaries, the EU AI Act represents a significant shift in how AI systems must be managed, documented, and explained. This document is a crucial resource for understanding both the spirit and letter of the legislation, enabling professionals to align actuarial models with ethical standards and legal mandates in the European regulatory environment.
