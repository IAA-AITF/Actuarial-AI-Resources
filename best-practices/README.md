  - **Summary:**  
    This guide from OpenAI is a comprehensive and practical resource for developers, product teams, and technical leaders interested in designing and deploying LLM-powered agents. The document outlines foundational principles for identifying agent-suitable use cases—particularly those involving complex decision-making, high rule maintenance burdens, and reliance on unstructured data—and contrasts agent workflows with traditional automation approaches.

    The guide walks through the key building blocks of an agent, namely: model selection, tool integration, and detailed instruction engineering. It includes coding examples using OpenAI's Agents SDK, demonstrating how to construct agents capable of performing tasks autonomously. Special focus is given to agent orchestration strategies—whether using single-agent loops or complex multi-agent systems through manager and decentralized patterns.

    A central theme is safety and predictability. The guide provides a deep dive into implementing robust guardrails, covering input filtering, safety classifiers, tool risk assessments, and conditions that trigger human-in-the-loop interventions. These safeguards are crucial for actuaries looking to responsibly integrate AI agents into domains with financial, legal, or ethical sensitivities.

    Designed with an incremental development philosophy, the guide encourages starting with simple prototypes and evolving to more complex systems only as needed. It emphasizes flexibility, scalability, and responsible deployment practices—making it an excellent reference for actuaries developing AI systems intended for regulated or sensitive environments.
